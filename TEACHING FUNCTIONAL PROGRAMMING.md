#Introduction
* Michael Sperber
* Not sure he knows how to teach how to teach
* Teaching since 1987
* Languages in Dr. Racket built explicitly for teaching beginners
* Not Racket itself (Racket is a professional FPL)

#REFERENCES
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Book, programming)
* How To Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing (Book, programming, online, free)
* Mindset: The New Psychology of Success (Book, selfhelp)

#The One Thing
If what you're teaching is compelling to you, that does not mean that it is compelling to students, or that it is a good thing to teach or method of teaching

We don't want to teach syntax or whatever,
We want to know: At the end of your course, are your students able to program.

#Teaching Stuff
* Students will look for ways to implement what they know in your programming language
* Using scheme, a student who knows java may find a way that:
	* They can "return" to end a program
	* They can access state of their program
	* They can assign or mutate a value
* Your students are NOT YOU
* Students will come in to courses with a different mindset
* Think Scheme is a wonderful language, so it must be wonderful for teaching
	* This is not so.

#Make Teaching Effective
* Be systematic/methodical in your teaching
	* Functional programming supports this
* "Design Recipes", like essay composition structure
	* Will use the same approach to write programs
* "Bootcamp Approach" vs "Friendly Kitten Approach"
	* Bootcamp works better with no detriment to popularity of teacher/course
* Form
	* Even necessary in programming
	* "Multiple solutions" is actually detrement
	* Should have a "right" solution to a problem (in teaching)
* Feedback
	* You want an environment that gives immediate, useful feedback to students
* Don't start teaching with Types
	* Feedback is not always useful
	* Will block students in ways that serve no useful purpose

#Intro summary
* Don't grow attached to your own tools
	* Functional programming
	* Specific language
* Students don't have to love you
* Only program what you can explain
	* Don't give examples with out of scope code
* Observe & measure your students
* "Kill your darlings"


#GEMOETRIC SHAPES
* Taken from old US Navy problem
* Squares, circles, overlayed shapes
* Find out if one point is inside a certain geometric shapen on a grid
